## üöÄ Installation!

Clone the repository and navigate to the project directory:
```bash

## üéÆ Running the Program

* #### Philosophers:
```bash
./philo number_of_philosophers time_to_die time_to_eat time_to_sleep
[number_of_times_each_philosopher_must_eat]
```
*(the program accepts positive numbers as input values)*

* ##### number_of_philosophers: The number of philosophers and also the number of forks.
* ##### time_to_die (in milliseconds): If a philosopher didn‚Äôt start eating time_to_die
milliseconds since the beginning of their last meal or the beginning of the sim-
ulation, they die.
* ##### time_to_eat (in milliseconds): The time it takes for a philosopher to eat.
During that time, they will need to hold two forks.
* ##### time_to_sleep (in milliseconds): The time a philosopher will spend sleeping.
* ##### number_of_times_each_philosopher_must_eat (optional argument): If all
philosophers have eaten at least number_of_times_each_philosopher_must_eat
times, the simulation stops. If not specified, the simulation stops when a
philosopher dies.
